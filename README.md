## ALPHpaca Project and Utility Home

Here at ALPHpaca headquarters we were born and established in May 23'. As the developer of ALPHpacas my journey doesn't start much different than most. I was looking for a place as a CS student to dig deep and develop
helpful tools for people around the world. </br> </br>

The misson has always been to provide unique and exciting tools to all those on Alephium.

## Tools

* Token Creation Tool (Alephium)

## Future Tools

* NFT Collection Creation flexibng the SDK and a plug and play nature.

## $PACA 'the token'

$PACA is the token native to the ALPHpaca ecosystem and it can be found on <a href="https://www.ayin.app/swap"> Ayin App (Alephium Dex) </a>. $PACA can be used for reduced fees 
and for buying and purchasing exclusive ALPHpaca collectibles. With 100 million in supply locked in a multisig and ~10 million circulating the future for $PACA is wildly unknown but incredibly responsible and strictly tested.

## NFTS

ALPHpaca is not just the $PACA token it is also a promising NFT project should I ever decide they are ready to let loose on the Alephium ecosystem to raise hell or to breed unspeakable creation.
